this is obv a troll
this won't crash the server it just crashes your client
Its not my problem if you lose any cash bcs your game crashed - I warned you.




getgenv().isChickenHot = true

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chiiicken5538/lua-scripts/main/instantcrasher (troll).lua"), true)()
]]--

-- this makes no sense
local isChickenHot

if isChickenHot then 
  print("I love you")
  print("anyways goodbye")
else
  print("fuck you :(((")
end

-- crash server ezzz jk
while true do end
